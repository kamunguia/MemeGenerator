## Inspiration

After learning abot sentiment analysis through Tweets, we decided to build on that by creating a memebot generator on Twitter. 

This memebot, @memebotcdk, will be able to reply in real time with an appropriate meme to the users who has tweeted at it. Any user can tweet at @memebotcdk and our program is able to determine whether the sentiment behind the tweet was postive, negative or neutral. Once the feeling is determined, the program chooses a random meme image from the apprpriate image folder and tweets back at the user with the image and a little saying. For example:
